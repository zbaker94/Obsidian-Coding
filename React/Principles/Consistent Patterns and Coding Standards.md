It is vital when working on a large system and / or a component library to have a standard for naming and common coding patterns. These will not apply in all cases but they allow a developer to offload some mental bandwidth and fall back on the naming and structure when coding or trying to find something in the code. 

***Patterns***
- [[Best practices for balancing customization with configuration and ensuring reusability#Renderers and Components|Renderers and Components (Container and Layout components)]]
- [[Conditional Rendering]]
- [[Compound Component]]
- [[Higher-Order Component Pattern]] 
- [[Controlled Components]]

- Imports and Exports ([[Library Structure|Library Structure]])
-  Following established patterns
