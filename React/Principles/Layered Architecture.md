Layered architecture is a principle that applies in many areas of software development and specifically when writing code for others to use. The desire to provide a set of building blocks that do not force a developer to fully opt in or opt out of your tools increases the likelihood of long term adoption. This makes your code more [[Reusable vs Useful|Useful]]. Furthermore, a layered architecture makes your code more easily extendable in the future and therefore simpler to maintain with less risk of painting yourself into a corner.


## What is it?
Long story short, layered architecture is the idea that having multiple layers of abstraction will result in the above benefits. To do so, you must separate what differs from what stays the same with an eye towards flexibility. A reusable component is no good if a future requirement means having to rebuild it.
