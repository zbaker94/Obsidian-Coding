Encapsulation in the context of React is similar to the broader software engineering / object oriented principle of [[Coding/Principles/Encapsulation|Encapsulation]]. Specifically, this means that props such as config values, children, etc. and side effects should be consistent such that the usage of a component does not depend on the internal implementation. This set of props and behavior can be considered the "interface" in the best practice of "code to the interface not the implementation".
