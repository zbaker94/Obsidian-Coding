A React functional component is simple a JavaScript function that returns a React element. React elements are defined using JSX (a markdown language that mixes JavaScript and XML/HTML). The benefits of functional components are primarily their simplicity when compared to [[Class Components]]. Previously if you wanted to interact with the [[React Lifecycle]] such as using state or running code when a component mounts, you would have to use a class component whose syntax and quirks were confusing and cumbersome. That issue has been resolved with the advent of [[Hooks]].
