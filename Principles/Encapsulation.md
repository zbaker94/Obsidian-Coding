Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods or functions that operate on that data. This enables the decoupling of implementation details from the interface. Encapsulation allows developers to present a consistent and usable interface which is independent of how a system is implemented internally. As one example, encapsulation can be used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming) "Class (computer programming)"), preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science) "State (computer science)") invariance maintained by the methods.
