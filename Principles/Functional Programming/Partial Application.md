In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), **partial application** (or **partial function application**) refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity "Arity"). Partial application is sometimes incorrectly called [[Currying]], which is a related, but distinct concept.
