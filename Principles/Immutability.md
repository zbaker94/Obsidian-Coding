Immutability is a software design principle that states that **an object should not be able to be modified once it's been created**. Enforcing immutability can help prevent bugs and ensure that data is not corrupted. This is in contrast to a **mutable object** (changeable object), which can be modified after it is created. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object#cite_note-3) In some cases, an object is considered immutable even if some internally used attributes change, but the object's state appears unchanging from an external point of view. For example, an object that uses [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization "Memoization") to cache the results of expensive computations could still be considered an immutable object.
